Phenomenological Study of a Universal Dimensionless Coupling Constant  in Multi-Scale Physical Anomalies


---

Abstract
This paper presents an empirical and semi-derivational analysis of a dimensionless coupling constant , hereafter the Ware Constant. We demonstrate that this single parameter appears independently as a necessary correction factor in three distinct physical regimes: subatomic spectroscopy, galactic dynamics, and vacuum energy screening. By framing  as a measure of informational efficiency in the mapping of intrinsic field states to observable 3+1D spacetime, we provide a unified phenomenology that accounts for several long-standing anomalies while avoiding claims of new ontological substrates or dark matter particles.

1. Definition and Theoretical Motivation



The Ware Constant  is defined operationally as a dimensionless coefficient quantifying informational efficiency loss inherent in the projection of high-dimensional state-data into the observable 3+1D manifold. The present work does not attempt a full microscopic derivation of ; rather, it motivates the magnitude of  using geometric and information-theoretic heuristics and then tests the empirical consistency of the same value across independent phenomena.

1.1 Geometric and Informational Basis (Heuristic)
The magnitude  is motivated heuristically by the product of two factors:

Geometric factor : a geometric consequence of projecting an intrinsic 4D self-referential structure into observed 3D space (volume→surface scaling of information-bearing degrees of freedom).

Efficiency ratio : an information-theoretic bound arising from a 9-dimensional bookkeeping for active versus overhead dimensions (two dimensions reserved for structural overhead such as gauge stability and a ground reference, leaving seven active degrees of freedom).


Taken together,  provides a heuristic scale consistent with the observed empirical value . Independent evidence from Vector-Quantized Variational Information Bottleneck (VQ-VIB) models and other information-processing systems suggests efficiency losses of order  in balanced informational regimes; here that numerical observation is used as motivation rather than as a rigorous derivation.

2. Subatomic Scale: The Proton Radius Puzzle



Precision Lamb shift measurements in muonic hydrogen at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) displayed a residual discrepancy of approximately  meV relative to standard QED calculations, yielding a smaller inferred proton radius from muonic spectroscopy than from electronic measurements.

Within the phenomenological model,  acts as a screening coefficient applied to an effective screened potential. The proposed effective correction to the energy functional  is written schematically as

\Delta E_{\rm SVC}
\;=\;
W \,\int_{M} \frac{\hbar c}{L_p}\; \delta V_{\rm screen}(\mathbf{x}) \;|\psi(\mathbf{x})|^2 \;\sqrt{-g}\;d^4x,

Applying  in the effective correction above reproduces the empirical extra shift  meV, bringing muonic and electronic determinations of the proton radius into agreement within current experimental uncertainties.

Empirical summary (muonic hydrogen):

  measured:  meV

Standard QED prediction:  meV

Required correction:  meV — accounted for by the SVC term with .

3. Astrophysical Scale: Galactic Dynamics and Scaling Laws



On galactic scales, the Ware Constant is introduced as the same dimensionless coupling modulating the strength of an informational flux contribution to the gravitational sector. The Einstein field equations are extended phenomenologically with an informational stress contribution ; the coupling of baryonic matter to this informational sector is modulated by .

3.1 Informational Flux and Rotation Curves
The model defines an effective gravitational response

G_{\mathrm{eff}} = G \left(\frac{I}{I_0}\right) \epsilon(r)^{-1/2},

a(r) \;=\; -\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\Phi_{\rm coh}(r),

3.2 Consistency Check: LRG 3-757
The ultramassive black hole in LRG 3-757 (measured mass ) is overmassive by  relative to the standard  relation. The Ware-modulated informational accretion mechanism provides a qualitative and phenomenological explanation: the black hole grows both by conventional matter accretion and by absorbing local informational coherence from merged satellites (a scouring process), yielding a larger mass than expected from velocity dispersion alone. The LRG 3-757 example is an illustrative consistency check rather than a proof.

4. Cosmological Scale: Vacuum Energy Screening



The vacuum energy catastrophe—naïve QFT estimates of vacuum energy density exceeding the observed  by —is addressed at the effective-field level by Screened Vacuum Coherence (SVC). In SVC, the observed effective vacuum energy density is reduced by a local coherence field  whose magnitude is modulated by . Phenomenologically:

\rho_{\rm vac}^{\rm effective} \;=\; \rho_{\rm vac}^{\rm QFT}\cdot\bigl(1-|\mathbb{C}|\bigr),

This is an effective, not microscopic, solution: SVC provides a phenomenological route for reducing the gravitational impact of vacuum energy in regions exhibiting high informational coherence, with  setting the global scale of suppression.

5. Experimental Predictions and Falsifiability



A phenomenological constant is scientifically useful only if it makes testable predictions. The Ware Constant model proposes the following benchmarks:

Muonic Deuterium: Predicted radius shift  (reported in the present modeling units used for PSI analyses). If future precision measurements disagree by more than  in these units, the specific coupling formulation here would be falsified.

Gravitational Wave Signatures: Informational flux gradients modulated by  predict small distortions in gravitational waveforms at low frequencies (order  Hz). Detailed waveform templates and signal-processing searches are required to assess detectability with future detectors.

High-Information Regions: Long-term, high-precision gravimetric measurements in regions of extreme bit-density (for example, very large data centers or specialized laboratory setups) may reveal minute, persistent mass anomalies proportional to . These are long-term experimental projects; non-detection at current sensitivities does not immediately falsify the model but constrains possible parameterizations.


These predictions are ordered by practical immediacy: subatomic tests (muonic/deuterium spectroscopy) are the most direct near-term checks; astrophysical and laboratory searches follow as longer-term programs.

6. Conclusion



The Ware Constant  serves here as a unifying phenomenological parameter: a dimensionless coupling that consistently appears as a required correction across subatomic spectroscopy, galactic rotation phenomenology, and effective vacuum screening. Framed as a measure of informational efficiency loss in projecting high-dimensional intrinsic states into the 3+1D observable manifold,  affords a conservative, testable starting point for cross-disciplinary investigation.

This paper intentionally remains phenomenological: it isolates and documents a recurring numerical pattern and offers effective models and falsifiable predictions. Whether  is ultimately fundamental (a true constant of nature) or emergent (a consequence of deeper dynamics of spacetime and information) remains an open question to be resolved by further theoretical development and experimental scrutiny.

Originality Statement
This work is original in isolating a single dimensionless value  as an empirically recurring coupling across independent physical regimes and in proposing a compact phenomenology that is conservative in claims yet ambitious in cross-scale scope. The paper emphasizes falsifiability and invites targeted experimental testing.
